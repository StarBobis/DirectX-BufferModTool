# Third Party Warning

- DBMT have some close source program like:
- Plugins/DBMT.exe (Planing to move all code from C++ close source(https://github.com/StarBobis/DBMT-CPP) to DBMT-Core open source,it will need some time, maybe 3-6 months)
- Plugins/texconv.exe (I can't stop to use it,it's useful in texture batch convert, see: https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv)
- 3Dmigoto Loader.exe, 3Dmigoto Loader-ByPassACE.exe, CreateSuspendedProcess.exe (they come from old open source DBMT repository: https://github.com/StarBobis/DBMT-CPP)
- d3d11.dll (comes from https://github.com/StarBobis/3Dmigoto-GameMod-Fork)

- take your own risk to use them, all exe/dll can be manually replace with GIMI/XXMI's exe/dll if you think DBMT's dll/exe is in great dangers.
- DBMT will finally fully open source with C# to let community maintain it easily.
